# Concrete Compressive Strength

This activity it's a additional work for the university comparing the performance between 2 kind of regression model.  
In this case, we compare:
- Polynomial regression
- Kernel Ridge Regression

We measure the MSE to find the best model.

## Dataset
**Name:** Concrete Compressive Strength  
Available in the official website of *UC Irvine Machine Learning*.  

Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients.

Additional Information:
* Number of instances: 1030 
* Number of Attributes: 9 
* Attribute breakdown: 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable 
* Missing Attribute Values: None 
Given are the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database. (Yeh, 1998).
